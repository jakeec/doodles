- ### [Text wrap algorithm](/rust/src/text_wrap.rs)
  I needed a text wrap function for another project I'm working on and it turned out to be a more interesting problem than I would have thought.
- ### [Roman numerals kata](/rust/src/roman_numerals.rs)
  One of my favourite TDD katas. Here I did it for the first time in Rust.
- ### [Design by contract](/rust/src/design_by_contract.rs)
  Investigation into [Design by Contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) in Rust. Seeing if it has value, looking at existing DbC crates and implementing my own contract macros.
